  <h3>

    You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
   </li>
   <li>
    You must be able to explain what each component is doing
   </li>
   <li>
    You must be able to explain system redundancy

    Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
   Requirements
  </h2>
  <h3>
   General
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A
    <code>
     README.md
    </code>
    file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
   </li>
   <li>
    For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
   </li>
   <li>
    This project will be manually reviewed:
   </li>
   <li>
    As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
   </li>
   <li>
    Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use
    <a href="https://imgur.com/" target="_blank" title="imgur">
     imgur
    </a>
    but feel free to use anything you want).
   </li>
   <li>
    For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
   </li>
   <li>
    After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
   </li>
   <li>
    You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
   </li>
   <li>
    Focus on what you are being asked:
   </li>
   <li>
    Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
   </li>
   <li>
    Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
   </li>
   <li>
    Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
   </li>
   <li>
    In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
   </li>
  </ul>
