Files and directories starting with a dot (.) should be listed. The listing should be alpha ordered, except for the directories . and .. which should be listed at the very beginning. Only digits and letters are used to sort; Digits should come first. You can assume that all the files we will test with will have at least one letter or one digit. The listing should end with a new line.
